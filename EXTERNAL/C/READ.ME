        Writing C-language External Functions for 8088 SPITBOL
        ------------------------------------------------------

  --------
  At this time, only COM files can be loaded as external functions.  This
  requires that C programs be compiled using the Tiny memory model (and
  must be ORG'd to location 0x100).
  
  Although the Tiny model creates a COM file, external functions do
  not operate under a "true" Tiny model, because SS != DS.  That is,
  external functions use SPITBOL's stack, not their own.  This will
  create problems if you take the address of a variable on the
  stack and attempt to pass it to a C library function.
  
  Integer arguments are passed to and returned by external functions as
  long (32-bit) values, regardless of whether you are running SPITPC16
  or SPITPC32.  That is, the same external function will work with
  both versions.

  Your main function should be named mainslf().  The entry() macro
  in extrn88.h takes care of this.
  
  The file TINY.OBJ provides the necessary startup code to create a 
  COM file and transfer control to mainslf.  Note that no attempt is
  made to initialize C library routines, such as stdio, and they cannot
  be used.  Therefore, you cannot use C-library functions such as
  printf or malloc.

  The file FLOAT.OBJ provides the necessary definitions that are needed
  to satisfy references generated by real number operations in C code.
  It allows floating point operations to use the 80x87 emulator that is
  present in SPITBOL.

  Note that if an external function is built with the emulated floating
  point opcodes, executed on a machine with an 80x87, and then saved
  in a SAVE file with the EXIT function, it will be saved with the
  true 80x87 opcode (as modified by the emulator), and future use of
  the function when the Save file is reloaded will only operate properly
  if executed on a machine with an 80x87.
  
  The library file EXTRNLIB.LIB provides several functions for copying
  data between SPITBOL's data space and the function's data space.  It
  also provides functions for returning various data types.  See the
  file EXTRNLIB.C for a list of functions provided.

  The batch file CSLFTINY.BAT will compile and link a C program.  For
  example:
  
  	C:>CSLFTINY TESTCEF1
